				<b>A psalm of David.</b> <br>
				<b>1 - </b> The Lord is my shepherd, I lack nothing. <br>
				<b>2 - </b>He makes me lie down in green pastures,
				he leads me beside quiet waters, <br>
				<b>3 - </b>     he refreshes my soul.
				He guides me along the right paths
					for his nameâ€™s sake. <br>
				<b>4 - </b> Even though I walk
					through the darkest valley,[a]
				I will fear no evil,
					for you are with me;
				your rod and your staff,
					they comfort me. <br>
				
				<b>5 - </b> You prepare a table before me
					in the presence of my enemies.
				You anoint my head with oil;
					my cup overflows. <br>
				<b>6 - </b> Surely your goodness and love will follow me
					all the days of my life,
				and I will dwell in the house of the Lord

				<b>1 - </b> He that dwells in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. <br>
				<b>2 - </b> I will say of the LORD, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust. <br>
				<b>3 - </b> Surely he shall deliver you from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence. <br>
				<b>4 - </b> He shall cover you with his feathers, and under his wings shall you trust: his truth shall be your shield and buckler. <br>
				<b>5 - </b> You shall not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flies by day; <br>
				<b>6 - </b> Nor for the pestilence that walks in darkness; nor for the destruction that wastes at noonday. <br>
				<b>7 - </b> A thousand shall fall at your side, and ten thousand at your right hand; but it shall not come near you. <br>
				<b>8 - </b> Only with your eyes shall you behold and see the reward of the wicked.<br>
				<b>9 - </b> Because you have made the LORD, which is my refuge, even the most High, your habitation; <br>
				<b>10 - </b> There shall no evil befall you, neither shall any plague come near your dwelling. <br>
				<b>11 - </b> For he shall give his angels charge over you, to keep you in all your ways. <br>
				<b>12 - </b> They shall bear you up in their hands, lest you dash your foot against a stone. <br>
				<b>13 - </b> You shall tread on the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shall you trample under feet. <br>
				<b>14 - </b> Because he has set his love on me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he has known my name. <br>
				<b>15 - </b> He shall call on me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honor him. <br>
				<b>16 - </b> With long life will I satisfy him, and show him my salvation. <br>
